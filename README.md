# StudyHours
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict pass/fail status based on study hours. The model is trained on a dataset, evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix, and visualized with a logistic curve. Users can input study hours to get predictions. It demonstrates machine learning concepts in a simple, interactive way. ðŸš€
